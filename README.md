# [Daroach.net Live HTML](https://daroach.net/)
> the html for my homelab webserver. https://daroach.net/

after much deliberation, i settled with a [material design](https://vuematerial.io/) front end and vuejs backend. The deliberation was solely spent on the front end. [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) is great.

## **FEEDBACK IS ENCOURAGED**

please contact me through any means. i am always looking to improve both your skills and my own.

## Deployment setup

[docker-compose up](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/)

gets hit by jwilder's [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) companion container. absolutely great stuff.


## Development setup
