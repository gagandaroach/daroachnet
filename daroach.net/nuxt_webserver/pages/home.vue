          It has been a life goal to host a website on the internet. I envy those who grew up during the dot com boom. Daroach.net is a stack of web services running on my server.

          I use docker to modularize each microservice, and docker-compose to organize each microservice stack. The nginx-proxy-letencrypt directory contains the primary entrypoint for daroach.net, routing traffic to the other services.

          Organized by domain name, each folder contains the microservice source code, docker-compose.yml stack description, and configuration details.

          This website is is written in javascript, using the Vue and Nuxt Frameworks. The analytics use api.daroach.net, an ExpressJS service.

          description: `
          For use of deep learning algorithms in clinical practice, detailed justification for diagnosis is necessary. Con-volutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been demonstrated to classify prostatic histology using the samediagnostic signals as pathologists.  Using the StyleGAN series of networks, we demonstrate that recent ad-vances in high-resolution image synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be applied toprostatic histology.   The trained network can produce novel histology samples indistinguishable from realhistology at 1024x1024 resolution and can learn disentangled representations of histologic semantics that sep-arates at a variety of scales. Through blending of the latent representations, users have the ability to control theprojection of histologic semantics onto a reconstructed image.  When applied to the medical domain withoutmodification, StyleGAN2 is able to achieve a Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) of 3.69 and perceptual pathlength (PPL) of 33.25

          description: `
          Radiogenomic map linking image features and gene expression profiles has great potential for  non-invasively identifying molecular properties of a particular type of disease.  Conventionally, such map is produced in three independent steps: 1) gene-clustering to metagenes, 2) image feature extraction, and 3) statistical correlation between metagenes and image features. Each step is separately performed and relies on arbitrary measurements without considering the correlation among each other. In this work, we investigate the potential of an end-to-end method fusing gene code with image features to generate synthetic pathology image and learn radiogenomic map simultaneously. To achieve this goal, we develop a multi-conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) conditioned on both background images and gene expression code, synthesizing the corresponding image. Image and gene features are fused at different scales to ensure both the separation of pathology part and background, as well as the realism and quality of the synthesized image. We tested our method on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed method produces realistic synthetic images, and provides a promising way to find gene-image relationship in a holistic end-to-end manner.
