# Lab Report
#### Gagan Daroach

The lab was straightforward. 

I was able to learn all aspects of HTML and CSS using w3 and mozilla references. 

The slides you provided were a good starting point before I started reading online documentation. 

Before this lab, I had never written a CSS or HTML file. The code example was also very helpful.
